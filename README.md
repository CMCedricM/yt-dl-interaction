# Summary 
Using the yt api I grab all video id's of a playlist that is set in the settings.json file, and store all these id's in firebase. 
With this project I was able to gain an understanding of getting data from an api and storing it in a database service such as firebase.I also gained an understanding on using the subprocess module and requests module.
